# Daggerheart System for Foundry VTT

This is a community-created implementation of the **Daggerheart** tabletop roleplaying system by Darrington Press, developed for use in [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). It aims to bring the rich mechanics and narrative tools of Daggerheart to the digital space, enabling GMs and players to run full campaigns directly inside Foundry.

## ⚠️ Project Status

> **Note:** This system is under active development. Core item structures are implemented, including:
- Equipment
- Domain Cards
- Classes & Subclasses
- Ancestries & Communities

Character sheet development is in progress.

Working toward a beta release compatible with the Daggerheart SRD.

## 📦 Features in Progress

- Create and manage Daggerheart characters using custom item sheets
- Automate in-chat actions such as rolls, resource spending, and more
- Domain card system with loadout and vault logic
- Modular support for features based on ancestry, community, and subclass

## 🔧 Installation

To install manually:
